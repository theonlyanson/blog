Hello Folks,

Today, I encountered a challenging issue when my network driver mysteriously vanished. I decided to investigate this problem, and I'd like to share the steps I took to resolve it.

## Step 1: Checking Network Interfaces

First, I ran the following command to verify the presence of the `wlan0` interface:

```
ifconfig
```
To my surprise, wlan0 was nowhere to be found.

## Step 2: Restarting NetworkManager

I attempted to restart the NetworkManager service with the following commands:


```bash
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```
Unfortunately, these actions didn't provide a solution.

## Step 3: Reinstalling NetworkManager

After conducting some research, I decided to reinstall NetworkManager, thinking it might resolve any missing dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install NetworkManager
```

Regrettably, this approach also proved ineffective.

## Step 4: Customizing Network Configuration
Desperate for a solution, I ventured into customizing a configuration file. To do this, follow these steps:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```
Once inside the configuration file, append the following lines:

```bash
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```
After saving the changes and rebooting the system, the eth0 network interface appeared when I executed:

```bash
ifconfig
```

## Step 5: Exploring the GUI Option

Digging deeper into the issue, I stumbled upon an alternative method using the GUI. To test this approach, enter the following command in your terminal:

```
nm-connection-editor
```
This command opens a window displaying all available network interfaces. If any network interface is missing (as was the case with eth0), you can add it through the GUI interface.

With these steps, I was able to restore my network connectivity and resolve the missing network driver issue. Troubleshooting network problems can be challenging, but with patience and persistence, solutions can be found.

Best regards,
